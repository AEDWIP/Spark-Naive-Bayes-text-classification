# Spark-Naive-Bayes-text-classification
Demonstrates how to use spark to implement a Bayes text classifier

This code example demonstrates how to use spark to 

1. create machine learning pipeline
2. train a Naive Bayes text classifier
3. evaluate and explore the learned model
4. make predictions

The example uses the data set from [http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/naive-bayes-text-classification-1.html](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/naive-bayes-text-classification-1.html}

The example does not produce the same results as the published paper
